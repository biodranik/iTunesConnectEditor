# iTunes Connect Metadata Editor and Screenshots Uploader

This tool was designed to make an app update process easier:
 - Change any textual information about your app for any app localization language
 - Easily upload custom screenshots for any app localization language

## HOW TO USE:
 1. You need to install Application Loader from Apple either by installing XCode or by checking instructions here: http://help.como.com/Submit-My-App
 2. Fetch info about the app which needs to be updated (updated version should be already added in iTunesConnect).
 3. Edit any info and drag any new screenshots (I would recommend to put screenshots into language-folders, the app will automatically detect their size and the device).
 4. Upload :)

## ISSUES (hope to fix them in the future):
 - For now, the app freezes when uploads all information, but don't worry - it actually uploads everything.
 - I would recommend to launch it from console (Terminal app) to see actual logs and what is going on under the hood.
